**Name**
If you've thought of one, suggest a short name that gives a good hint about the purpose of the rule. Multiple words must be separated by hyphen. Avoid a name with more than 4 words.

**Problem**
The problem you faced while writing/analysing the code.

**Description**
What should the rule do, i.e., **how** should it solve the problem you faced?

**Priority**
If you'd like to, you can indicate the priority of this rule for your organisation. Priority can be `High` (meaning the rule will be a massive improvement for your workflow), `Medium` or `Low`.
